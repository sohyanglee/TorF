"Hey, are you okay? Are you hurt a lot?? Did you go to the hospital?",1

Do you remember where you last put it?,1
why???,1
Why do I feel bad??,1
who??,1
"Well then, let's ventilate the room for today and go to a sauna or a room and sleep for a day. That's sick house syndrome.",1
"Did I eat something wrong? If it hurts a lot, go to the hospital.",0
Double the sadness~,0
Are you hurt?,0
I see,0
Let's aim for the next test~,0
Why are you hurt?,0

"If you think you can find it, try to find it. If you think you can't, just forget about it.",0

What is it? Why is it hurt? Where did it come from? Who is it? It hurts?,1
Congratulations~~~~~~~,1

Two sorrows,0
Where and how much did you get hurt?,0
Thank you... I like you too...,0
Geuk... Where doesn't it fit?,0
"Hey, are you okay? Did I do something wrong?",0
Do I look tired?,0
Are you hurt? Where did you get hurt?,0
Congratulations~ You worked hard,0
Do you remember where you last saw it?,0
It sounds delicious... What's going on?,0
Geuk... Why do you say you don't like it?,0
"If you don't buy an air purifier, open the door and go out for a moment.",0
"Wow, did you take your medicine? Let's go to the hospital ㅜㅜ",1
double,1
are you okay? Are you hurt a lot?,1
Me too haha,1
Wow... that's right... (upset),1
You can do better next time. Thank you for your hard work.,1
How did you get hurt? Are you okay?,1
I’m touched. Thank you..,1
Congratulations so much! I came back as much as I worked hard haha,1
Let’s find it together ㅜㅜ,1
What happened!! It's hard work ㅜㅜ,1
How do you feel now? Did you enjoy it?,1
(upset) (hurt),1
What do we do…,1
"Oh my, how are you okay?? Does it hurt a lot??",1
There will be more people who share their sadness.,1
Are you hurt a lot?? What about your body?,1
"Hey, I like you too~",1
Thank you for liking me~,1
"(Scar) Oh, that's right...what part of it made you feel that way?",1
"It's okay, there's a next test, so don't be too depressed and solve it with me today.",1
"Thank you so muchㅜㅠThanks to you, all the difficulties are gone!",1
How did you get hurt? Have you been to the hospital? Don’t be sick ㅜㅜ,1
I really congratulate you~~ As expected oo~ You’ve worked hard so far~,1
"Oh my, what should I do..do you remember how long it lasted??",1
"It's okay, if you look again slowly, it will be there somewhere. Don't worry too much.",1
"I guess there were some parts that didn't fit, but I made the right choice. I don't think you'll have much trouble in the meantime.",1
Why did something happen?? I hope you feel better after eating chicken.,1
Oh really..? Why.. what is the reason?? What did I do wrong?,1
"You're going through a lot of hardships. It's going to be hard, but let's just hang in there for a little while. Or would you like to come out and meet me for a little while?",1
oh my god… Have you been to the hospital?,0
Are you hurt anywhere? How did it happen? filled? What about the hospital?,0
thank you for liking me,0
okay? i think so too,0
"It's okay, there are many opportunities, so let's relax and cheer up by playing with me. Don't get discouraged.",0
thank you! It's touching,0
"You got hurt here, are you okay? Would you like a band?",0
congratulations!,0
Did you cherish it a lot? Where do you think you lost it?,0
Why do I feel bad ㅜㅜ,0
I think I would hate it!,0
oh my god…,0
Are you okay? What was the last thing you ate? I'll go with you,1
Giving your sorrow to others is comforting,1
I'll curse you and get over it so that you can pass on the painful sadness to me.,1
no? Where do you need me? I'll be right there,1
if i like you,1
I'm glad you liked me too,1
"What part? I like you, but I'm against it if possible.",1
Are you upset? This exam will take you one step further toward passing the next exam.,1
"Since you are a much better person than me, you will be able to see better next time!",1
Do I look tired? I'm having a hard time...,1
Why are you waiting here?,1
"It seems like you will take care of it, but it was a lot of trouble, right? happened",1
Where are you until you remember? Let's start by cutting it out.,1
What happened?,1
Why do I feel bad about this?,1
why? Someone says they hate me and wants to spread my word,1
Leave it alone and come to my house,1
"Later in the morning, when there is no car, I come together, open the door to ventilate the house, and then go home in the morning.",1
Take medicine and go to the hospital,0
sad,0
I need to go to the hospital,0
Yeah~,0
What test is it? Let's start preparing for the next time~,0
I think it will be taken care of.,0
Congratulations. What exam is it?,0
Oh my...,0
Congratulations~,0
What kind of chicken did you eat?,0
okay?,0
Let’s get some air for a day and get a room to sleep,0
I'm sorry I'm late. Did you wait long?,1
What's going on? Are you okay?,1
Do you want to come out and play with me?,1
What? What does it taste like?,1
Everyone else is equally sad,0
"You've fallen for my charm, good, good",0
Then there’s nothing I can do. Bye~,0
Did you fail unfortunately? See you next time~,0
Oh thank you let's eat together,0
Oh congratulations!!! So what should I prepare now?,0
Does eating chicken improve your mood?,0
"Ugh, why don’t you like me? But it’s okay because not everyone can like me",0
"What should I do? I have to open the door and ventilate, but the exhaust is coming in. Oh no... First, go to your parents' house and rest.",0
why me...? Will you remember...? What's going on?,0
Hung!!! What car did you buy???? What a collection of money... I'm jealous... haha,0
What is the interpretation of that dream?,0
Ernie...don't do that...I live for you...,0
"Hey, I'm not like you either haha. I actually like it better. There's no overlap.",0
"I admit it, I’m even more annoyed, so I can’t say anything.",0
dirty....,0
Is it okay if I buy an iPad...? What's difficult?,0
I think I'm pretty good at it??,0
"Thank you for the consolation, but I'm still not in a good mood and the result was ruined.",0
Who likes you when you say this?,0
"Sorry, I crossed the line, but please speak nicely too.",0
This...? why....? okay.....,1
Did I do poorly? But why say it in a place where everyone is together?,1
I'm sorry ㅠㅜㅠ I was late because I had work to do ㅠㅜㅠ I waited a long time ㅠㅜㅠ,1
Eh? why? For what?? badly? are you okay?,1
It's a carrot.,1
I'm so so sad and upset,1
"Come visit my house! Let’s rest at home, eat delicious food and play with me!",1
omg?! What?! Did you think of me?! I'm so touched. Let's definitely go eat with me later.,1
There was also a sub-account..? Why didn't I know...?,1
"Do as you are told, robot.",0
"I tried hard, but I wasn't good at it.",0
right? Did I do well?,0
Ernie...don't do that...I live for you...,0
"Hey, I'm not like you either haha. I actually like it better. There's no overlap.",0
"I admit it, I’m even more annoyed, so I can’t say anything.",0
dirty....,0
Is it okay if I bought an iPad...? What's difficult?,0
I think I'm pretty good at it??,0
"Thank you for the consolation, but I'm still not in a good mood and the result was ruined.",1
Who likes you when you say this?,0
"Sorry, I crossed the line, but please speak nicely too.",0
This...? why....? okay.....,0
Did I do poorly? But why say it in a place where everyone is together?,0
I'm sorry ㅠㅜㅠ I was late because I had work to do ㅠㅜㅠ I waited a long time ㅠㅜㅠ,0
Eh? why? For what?? badly? are you okay?,0
It's a carrot.,0
I'm so so sad and upset,0
"Come visit my house! Let’s rest at home, eat delicious food and play with me!",1
omg?! What?! Did you think of me?! I'm so touched. Let's definitely go eat with me later.,1
There was also a sub-account..? Why didn't I know...?,1
"Do as you are told, robot.",1
"I tried hard, but I wasn't good at it.",1
right? Did you do well?,1
"If I pretend to think about it and then reject it, I'll be less hurt, right??",1
oh my god! How can that be?,1
"No matter what, your lover didn’t do well. You must be upset.",1
"Wow, I'm upset. Come out and buy me a drink.",1
She must have had a hard time saving money.,1
I'm not cheap? Did I act rudely??,1
Who are you to disparage my efforts? I tried,1
Don't be sick... Shall I stay with you?,1
"The moon is pretty, but why are you thinking about me?",0
I see,0
why? Are you thinking of me?,0
What car?,0
How much did you pay for it? Got a loan?,0
Oh~~ I’m really jealous of you buying a car.,0
Hurt a lot? Go to the hospital quickly,0
Where are you hurt? Tell me what the accident was,0
Oh yeah?,0
whatever,0
But why are you telling me that?,0
It's a dog dream,0
Oh really?,0
How many teeth?,0
Upper teeth? Lower teeth?,0
Who picked it?,0
however?,0
Isn’t this a sign that I’m going to the dentist soon?,0
What kind of justification is this?,0
Then try dying right now,0
Is it really necessary?,0
Umm... really? why??,0
Why are you dying again?,0
Uh... do whatever you want.,0
I don't think I can do that,0
Why are you so burdensome?,0
"The environment we've lived in is different, but there's nothing we can do about it.",0
admit,0
"Does it have to fit? Even if we don’t get along, we can play well together.",0
This can be happen,0
oh? Which part?,0
i think so too,0
Then you cut your losses?,0
So you hate it?,0
I can't help it,0
It's a compliment to say you're good at your job.,0
"I don't like to praise, but I feel like I'm praising you because you're so good haha, you're a professional.",0
Oh... I'm good at my job? Awesome~,0
"Ugh, it seems like you’re jealous because I’m good at my job.",0
"Oh, what kind of dry shampoo do you use?",0
"It's not noticeable, it's awesome",0
Why don’t you just breathe?,0
Is dry shampoo comfortable?? How much is it?,0
What version is it?,0
Congratulations~~ (not interested at all),0
What model?,0
go to the hospital,0
I'm hungry...,0
Am I a genius?,0
Are you talented? thank you,0
I know.,0
"Yeah, what should I do?",0
That's right,0
"No, that's what I said",0
How can you pretend to know something when you don’t know it?,0
It’s too much.. Why do you talk like that?,1
"Don't say that, it really hurts..",1
Why do you hate me? What did I do wrong?,1
yes?? I think I can do better next time. Thank you so much.,1
Who are you to judge my efforts? I worked hard too,1
I tried so hard... please don't judge me that way.,1
Does it hurt a lot? Don’t be sick.. go to the hospital.,1
why? Are you open? Where are you hurt?? are you okay???,1
What's going on?,1
Are you feeling better? I hope it gets better...,1
Why were you depressed???,1
are you okay? What made you tired?,1
You must be very tired? it's fine now??,1
"Not cheap? Ha, I feel bad",1
Who are you to judge me? It’s ridiculous.,1
It's obvious that I'm good at my job and I'm not a cheesy person?? What is it?,1
"In what part did I feel that I wasn't cheap, or am I really not cheap? I was kind and kind to myself. Does this person hate me?",1
I? Isn't it cheap?? What can I do~ I only believe the words of those who have admitted to me.,1
He really doesn't have eyes for man.,1
"Oh no, where do I look? Who can judge them if they don't get cheaper!!",1
"Ok? (It's sad..) Well, you might think so.",1
Let's guess one by one!,1
Why don't you just say that it looks different?,1
"Which doesn't fit? If you tell me, let's guess it.",1
"Even if we don't like it, we seem to get along, right?",1
"I'll never ask you to die, so live with me for the rest of your life.",1
"No! Don't die, though.",1
I can die if I want to die.,1
Why should those who are going to die live?,1
"I don't think I'm going to say that, but does that mean you love me that much? Thank you and I'm impressed.",1
"Huh, really? What could I have done to get sick.",1
Real?? I must have been so scared.,1
OMG.. Have you searched for dream interpretation?? What do you say??,1
Did you get sick a lot?,1
Didn't you get sick in your dream? It's alright? I'd be surprised.,1
Are you okay? Are you hurt a lot?? What can I do?,1
Did you have an accident?? It's alright?? Here's what's going on.,1
It's cool to work hard and earn money to buy a car!! Good job.,1
I can feel how hard and hard you have saved the money!! Good for you.,1
"What? Did you think of me? I'm impressed, thank you.",1
You mean I'm as pretty as the moon?,1
Do you have an exact reason or proof that someone doesn't like me?,0
You can't help other people's feelings or opinions.,0
"If there are any complaints or comments, I'll see if there's anything to improve.",0
Feedback based on other people's opinions can be an important learning opportunity.,0
"If you want to know why you don't like it, you'd better talk to the person in person.",0
"If someone doesn't like me, I want to understand why.",0
I apologize if my actions or words have offended anyone.,0
Not everyone thinks favorably of me.,0
"You may have disagreements with others, and that's natural.",0
"If I have a complaint, I will understand the reason and find a way to improve.",0
"If someone doesn't like me, I respect their opinion.",0
"Every opinion is important, and we strive to receive fair feedback.",0
I will think about other people's dislikes and try to improve.,0
"If someone doesn't like it, we'll figure out why and try to find a solution.",0
"If someone doesn't like it, I'd like to know more about why.",0
You try to improve your relationships with others.,0
I'm open to listening to other people's opinions and making improvements.,0
Everyone has different tastes.,0
In what part do you think your taste doesn't match?,0
"If we have different tastes, how can we reconcile them?",0
Differences in tastes can sometimes be an interesting topic of conversation.,0
"Tastes can change over time, so let's talk about what we prefer.",0
Maybe our different tastes make each other more interesting.,0
Doesn't the fact that we have different tastes mean that we can enjoy more diversity?,0
Respect each other's different tastes and think about what activities you should choose to do together.,0
It's important to be considerate and respectful of each other just because you have different tastes.,0
Emotions and work skills should be considered separately.,0
"Panpan Man is an imaginary character, so I don't think he would actually be in that situation.",0
I think you need to think seriously about what sacrifices you need to make for your best friend.,0
"I think in order to make the best decision, you need to know exactly what is happening and why.",0
I think it's an extreme situation to remove your hair to help your best friend.,0
I think we need to consider realistic alternatives to make this decision.,0
I think the act of removing Lee is too extreme. There will be other solutions.,0
"I'll do my best to help my friend, but I don't think I'll consider actually taking my head off.",0
"I think it's a relationship that has a lot of feelings and affection for my best friends. So I guess in that situation, you want to help your friend as much as you can.",1
"I have a lot of affection for my friends, so I will do my best for them.",1
"I have a lot of affection for my friends, so in those moments, I'll do everything I can for them.",1
We should cherish the joy and creativity that the robot felt when it made the red tower.,1
The robot must have put a lot of effort into the tower. Why do we need to tear it down?,1
"I would have liked the memory of when the robot made the red tower, but I think it would hurt to tear it down.",1
We need to consider the meaning and emotion of the robot's creation of the red tower.,1
Wouldn't it be a bit harsh for a robot to bring down the red tower again? You have to take into account his efforts.,1
It's hard to understand when a robot asks you to take down a red tower.,1
I think it's better to respect the creativity and effort of robots and find other ways to do it.,1
"Considering the robot's feelings, I think we should consider the decision to bring down that tower.",1
Why not rebuild that tower without hurting the robot's feelings?,1
"The robot's efforts are important, but you may need to knock down towers if necessary.",0
"The robot built the tower, but it might make sense to tear it down for a new purpose",0
"Talent is important, but we couldn't have achieved this without hard work.",1
Thank you. I was able to achieve this result by working hard and using my talent,1
"Yes, thank you for saying you did a good job. It was a combination of hard work and talent.",1
"I'm sorry, it's really late. Thank you for waiting so much.",1
"I'm so sorry it's so late. I should respect your time, but I didn't",1
I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long. It won't be too late in the future,1
Sorry I'm late. It took longer because the road was blocked.,0
"I'm sorry. Something unexpected happened, so I arrived later.",0
"We came to see a movie together, why do you ask us to watch it separately? Don't want to watch a movie like me?",1
"We're here to watch a movie together, and it would be more fun to watch it together.",1
